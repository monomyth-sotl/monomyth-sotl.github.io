		</div>
			<p>When Starling enters Jack Crawford’s room, the Head of FBI’s Behavioural Science Services, she notices newspaper articles regarding Buffalo Bill, the mystery serial killer who skins the victims. Soon, Crawford enters the room, and gives Starling an assignment to interview Hannibal Lecter. The Behavioural Science department is interviewing all the serial killers in custody for psycho behavioural profile to help unsolved cases. Most of them are happy to talk with the FBI, but the one FBI wants the most to interview refused to cooperate - the psychiatrist Hannibal Lecter, or Hannibal “the Cannibal”. If Hannibal doesn’t want to cooperate, Crawford just wants straight reporting - how he looks, how his cell looks, if he is sketching, then what is he sketching. Crawford hands documents about Lecter, a copy of the questionnaire and a special ID to the asylum to Starling. Crawford warns Starling to be very careful with Hannibal Lecter, and to exactly follow the physical procedures Dr. Chilton at the asylum will go over those that are used with him. Starling faces beginnings of change in her trainee life.</p> 
      	<h4>Part 2: The Visit</h4>

			<p>Starling arrives at Baltimore State Forensic Hospital to fulfill her assignment. Dr. Chilton, the supervisor of the hospital, notes that the hospital has tried to study Hannibal Lecter in the past, but he was too sophisticated for the standardized tests. While guiding Starling to Hannibal, Dr. Chilton tells Starling the physical procedures she must follow at all costs. He says to not touch or approach the glass cell wall, only use the sliding food carrier, and to only hand him paper - no staples or paperclips.</p>

      <p>When Starling and Hannibal make an acquaintance, Hannibal refuses to accept the questionnaire right away. He asks several questions to Starling regarding Buffalo Bill, such as why he is called Buffalo Bill, and what makes him skin people. Starling calmly answers the questions.

		<p>Then, Hannibal tells Starling to hand the questionnaire, but is soon disappointed because of the bluntness of the questions to dissect him. Hannibal dissects Starling’s personal details just by her looks, such as where she is from, what family she grew up in. Moment of realization hits Starling that Hannibal is very smart and intelligent. However, Staring provokes Hannibal by saying, “Are you smart enough to point that high-powered perception at yourself? Or maybe you’re afraid to?”. Hannibal returns the questionnaire back to Starling through the food carrier, and mentions that he once ate a liver of a man who tried to test him with wine. He tells Starling, “fly back to school now, little Starling. Fly, fly, fly...” - he realized that Starling isn’t capable of interviewing him?</p>

		<h4>Part 1: At the F.B.I. Academy</h4>
			<div align="center">
				<img alt="overhead" src="../DreamWeaver Website/screenshots/5/5 - overhead.png" class="ss">
			</div>
		  	<p>Starling returns to the FBI, and goes back to her daily routine of training and studying. She continues with her investigation, and reads newspaper articles regarding Hannibal Lecter and his past patient, Mofet. Unfortunately, Lecter altered or destroyed the patient's history prior to his capture so Starling hasn’t found the patient yet, but Starling found a self-storage facility in downtown Baltimore, which is where Hannibal is from, called “Your Self Storage”. Starling commits to further investigate Buffalo Bill.</p>
			<div align="center">

				<img alt="head" src="../DreamWeaver Website/screenshots/5/5 - head.png" class="ss">
			</div>
			<p>Starling reaches out to the facility and enters Hester Mofet’s storage unit which was left abandoned for 10 years. Mofet’s unit is filled with stacks of miscellaneous items, and in the corner there sits a car covered with the flag of the US. In the abandoned car of the storage room, Starling finds the head of a man with makeup on in a bottle. Starling goes straight to Baltimore State Forensic Hospital to visit Hannibal. Hannibal says the man is Benjamin Raspail, a former patient of Hannibal who had exotic romantic attachments. Hannibal says that he didn’t kill Raspail, and that his death was the best thing for Raspail because his therapy was going nowhere. Raspail was garden variety manic-depressive, a tedious bipolar disorder symptom. Starling notices that Hannibal’s drawings have been taken down. Hannibal tells that it was a petty torment from Dr. Chilton for making Miggs kill himself, along with the gospel TV program. Hannibal says that he can help the FBI catch Buffalo Bill, by providing a psychological profile of Buffalo Bill based on the case evidence. Starling hesitates.

		<h4>Part 3: The Evidence</h4>

			<p>A body of a victim is found near Elk River, West Virginia. Crawford and Starling visit the site. During the examination of the corpse of the victim, Starling finds a cocoon in the victim’s throat. Starling visits a museum to get the researchers to identify the evidence found. The cocoon is identified as Acheronita, a special type of moth that is only found in Asia. Buffalo Bill imported the moth and raised it with care. </p>

		<h4>Part 4: The Deal</h4>
			<div align="center">
				<img alt="senator" src="../DreamWeaver Website/screenshots/5/5 - senator.png" class="ss">
			</div>
			<p>The next day, Catherine Martin, the daughter of Senator Ruth Martin, goes missing. Dr. Chilton is unhappy with the fact that Starling isn’t sharing information obtained from the interview of Hannibal Lecter with the hospital for the third time. He claims that he has rights to the information since Hannibal is his patient. Starling refuses to do so, but rather gives him the phone number of the U.S. Attorney’s office and tells him to let her do her job. </p>
			<div align="center">
				<img alt="deal" src="../DreamWeaver Website/screenshots/5/5 - deal.png" class="ss">
				<img alt="deal2" src="../DreamWeaver Website/screenshots/5/5 - deal2.png" class="ss">
			</div>
			<p>Starling goes to Hannibal, and offers a deal to cooperate with the investigation of Buffalo Bill, and in exchange, the Senator has offered to transfer Hannibal to the VA Hospital at Oneida Park, with the view of the woods nearby with maximum security. Also, one week of the year, Hannibal will get to leave the hospital and go to Plum Island under SWAT team surveillance. Of course, the deal is canceled if Catherine Martin dies. Hannibal accepts the offer, and says that if he tells Starling things, Starling should tell him things. He asks about Starling’s worst memories in her childhood. Starling responds that it is when his Starling’s father died from a shooting incident when she was 10 years old. Starling asks Hannibal why Buffalo Bill places the moth cocoon in victims’ throats. Hannibal says that the significance of the moth is ‘change’, and Buffalo Bill wants to change, too. He is not perfectly a transexual, only tries to be. Hannibal suggests that Bill has most likely been rejected to all three major centres that are known to perform sexual reassignment surgery - Johns Hopkins, University of Minnesota and Columbus Medical Centre. Hannibal says that big childhood disturbances associated with violence can cause this. Not a born criminal - a made criminal over years of systematic abuse. Bill hates his own identity and wants sexual transfer, but his pathology is 1000 times more savage and terrifying. Dr. Chilton was listening to the whole conversation between Hannibal and Starling.</p>
		<h4>Part 4: To Tennessee</h4>
			<div align="center">
				<img alt="enter" src="../DreamWeaver Website/screenshots/6/6 - chilton hannibal.png" class="ss">
			</div>
			<p>Dr. Chilton enters Hannibal’s cell, and tells Hannibal that he himself called Senator Ruth Martin and confirmed that there was no deal regarding Hannibal's transfer. Chilton tells Hannibal to identify Buffalo Bill by name, and if Catherine Martin is found in time, Senator Martin will have Hannibal transferred to Brushy Mountain, Tennessee. Hannibal only tells his first name, and claims that he will remain silent until he arrives at Tennessee. Hannibal focuses on Chilton’s pen to steal it.</p>

			</div>
			<p>The fake deal between Crawford and Hannibal is revealed. The Senator wants the Department of Justice to take over Hannibal from Memphis, Tennessee. Hannibal Lecter and Dr. Chilton arrive at Memphis International Airport. As they arrive, Senator Martin asks for further details of Buffalo Bill. Hannibal says that his real name is Louis Friend. Louis and Raspail were lovers, but Raspail became very frightened because Louis was a murderer and did ‘things’ with his skin. He describes Buffalo Bill’s features - 5’ 10, burnt, about 180 lbs, blonde hair, eyes pale blue, about 35 years old, and may have lied about his address. </p>
		<h4>Part 2: 'Simplicity'</h4>
			<div align="center">

				<img alt="clarice" src="../DreamWeaver Website/screenshots/6/6 - clarice.png" class="ss">
			</div>
			<p>Starling revisits Hannibal, locked at Shelby County Courthouse. Hannibal says that every information Starling needs is in the case file. He says that the first principle to finding Buffalo Bill is simplicity. What is it in itself? What is its nature? What needs does he serve by his killing? Starling responds, “Anger, social acceptance, sexual frustrations.” Hannibal says that he “covets,” and that is his nature. There are only five minutes left for Starling to interview Hannibal, but Hannibal insists to listen more about the reason why Starling ran away from her cousin’s farm in Montana when she was 10 years old. Starling responded that she heard screams at dawn, so she went downstairs to check the source of the sound. She crept into the barn and realized that it was the lambs. She opened the gate to the pen and attempted to free them, but they just stood there and kept wailing. Starling held onto one lamb and ran away from the farm with no destination in mind. She didn’t get more than a few miles, soon caught by a sheriff, then was sent to an orphanage. The lamb that she ran away with was killed. She mentions that she still has nightmares of this night. </p>

				<img alt="get out" src="../DreamWeaver Website/screenshots/6/6 - get out.png" class="ss">
			</div>
			<p>That moment, Dr. Chilton and the security guards enter, and push Starling out the room. Starling pleads Hannibal for Buffalo Bill’s real name, but he won’t answer. He just says to let him know when the lambs stop screaming. As Hannibal hands back the Buffalo Bill case file back to Starling, he gently strokes her hand. Starling, startled, withdraws her hand and is guided out the room. She gets on a plane, and safely returns back to the FBI Academy.</p>
		<h4>Part 3: The Escape</h4>
			<div align="center">
				<img alt="kill" src="../DreamWeaver Website/screenshots/6/6 - kill.png" class="ss">
			</div>
			<p>Hannibal escapes his cell by attacking the two officers who came to give him food. He brutally murders both of them. In the chaos, Hannibal tricks the police, SWAT team and medical staff by laying fake evidence to confuse them locating him. He changes outfits with the dead police and puts on the facial skin layer of the dead officers on his own face and tricks them that he is the injured officer. He gets on the ambulance, and when the medical staff is on the phone to report the severity of the injury back to the hospital, Hannibal attacks him and escapes from the van. Soon, the ambulance is found at a parking garage at Memphis Airport, and the whole crew is dead. Is Hannibal really an ally now? </p>
		<h4>Part 4: The Evidence</h4>

			</div>
			<p>Starling hears the news about Hannibal’s escape from her friend at the FBI Academy, Ardelia. However, Starling knows that Hannibal won’t attack him because he would consider that “rude”, but she thinks that the investigation came to a dead end, and that Catherine Martin will die soon. The two investigate based on the notes Hannibal wrote on the case file he returned back to Starling. The note said, “Clarice, doesn’t this random scattering of the site seem desperately random? Like the elaboration of a bad liar.” Ardelia notices that it is random because of the one girl, Frederica Bimmel, the one Buffalo Bill intentionally weighted down the river. She was the first victim taken, but the third body found. Based on the Lecter’s First Principles, simplicity, and that Buffalo Bill covets, and we covet what we see everyday, they realize that Buffalo Bill knew Frederica Bimmel.</p>

Starling goes up the staircase and enters Fredrica’s room. In her room, Starling finds a small box with polaroid pictures of Fredrica herself. Starling goes to the room across the hall, then finds mannequins and garments. She opens the closet, and notices a cloth cut-outs that have identical shapes as the skinned area of Frederica’s body. Starling immediately calls Crawford and reports the evidence and suggests that Buffalo Bill can be a skilled tailor or a dressmaker. She figures out that the reason he kidnaps big women is to get as much skin as possible, and to easily skin them by loosening their skin by starving them. Crawford calms Starling down, and says that the FBI have identified Buffalo Bill and his location, Calumet City, Illinois, and that they are on their way to capture him. His name is Jamie Gumm, known as John Grant. Crawford tells Starling that two years ago in LAX, he had records for importing live caterpillars from Asia. Crawford orders Starling to link the suspect to Fredrica Bimmel before his indictment. Starling follows his orders.</p>

Starling stops Buffalo Bill from trying to close the door, and asks if he has any contact information of Mrs. Lipman. She also asks Buffalo Bill if he knows anything about Fredrica Bimmel. He replies that he saw her name in the newspaper. He then offers Starling to come into the house while he finds the card of Mrs. Lipman’s son. While Buffalo Bill searches for the card, Starling scans the house and notices several suspicious items such as a roll of large plastic bags, numerous rolls of thread and most importantly, the moth. Instantly, Starling points her gun at Buffalo Bill and yells him to freeze and put his hand over his head.</p>

Buffalo Bill follows behind Starling as she carries on her search. The moment Buffalo Bill loads his gun to shoot Starling at her back, she immediately turns around and shoots multiple rounds of bullets at Buffalo Bill. She was able to find him in the dark because of the sound of him loading his gun. Buffalo Bill dies immediately.</p>

      <p>At the commencement ceremony, Starling gets a phone call from Hannibal Lecter.
		<br>
	   “Starling.”
		  <br>
	   “Clarice. Have the lambs stopped screaming?”
		  <br>
	   “Dr. Lecter.”
		  <br>
	   “Don’t bother with the trace. I won’t be on long enough.”
		  <br>
	   “Where are you Dr. Lecter?”
		  <br>
	   “I have no plans of calling you, Clarice. The world’s more interesting with you in it. So you take care now to extend me the same courtesy.”
		  <br>
	   “You know I can’t make that promise.”
		  <br>
	   “I do wish we could chat longer but I am having an old friend for dinner. Bye.”
		  <br>
		Hannibal gently warns Starling not to try to arrest him. </p>
